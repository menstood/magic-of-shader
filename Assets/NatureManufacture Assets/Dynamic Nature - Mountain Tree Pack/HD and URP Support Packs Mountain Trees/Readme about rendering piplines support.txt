To setup such version simply chose  proper urp or hd  version in package manager and install it.
We advice to setup fresh unity project and chose hd or urp pipline at start. 
It's very difficult to setup render pipline yourself in engine and upgrade standard project.

RP technology is very fluid and it's not possible to support bigger range of versions. 

For Unity 2023.2 HD or URP 16  please use 16 support packs, if you use higher RP version this files should also work.
