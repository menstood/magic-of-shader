BEFORE YOU START:
- you need Unity 2023.2+
- you need HD SRP pipline 16 or higher
- there is wind prefab which will manage wind at your scene
Be patient HD RP tech is so fluid... we coudn't follow every beta version

Step 1 - Import our HD RP 16 Unity 2023.2 Mountain Tree Pack compatibility pack
Step 2 - Setup Shadows and other render setups.
- !!!! IMPORTANT !!!! Open "Project settings" ->"Gaphics"-> "HDRP global settings" ->  "Diffusion Profile Assets"
		  NM_SSSSettings_Skin_Foliage
		  NM_SSSSettings_Skin_NM Foliage
		  NM_SSSSettings_Skin_NM Foliage Trees
	Without this foliage materials will not become affected by scattering and they will look wrong.
